#Write a program that reads two numbers M and N, and finds the product of the numbers from M to N that are divisible by 3. Print the product of the numbers from M to N that are divisible by 3. If there are no numbers that are divisible by 3 from M to N. Otherwise, print 1
M=int(input())
N=int(input())
pro=1
for i in range(M,N+1):
    if i%3==0:
        pro=pro*i
if pro!=1:
    print(pro)
else:
    print(1)
